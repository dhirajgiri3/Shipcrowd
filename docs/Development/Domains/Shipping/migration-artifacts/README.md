# Migration Artifacts

This folder stores code-verified migration and debt-burn artifacts.

## Files

1. `architecture-reality-check.md`
2. `plan-vs-reality-diff.md`
3. `verified-ratecard-dependency-map.md`
4. `client-ratecard-inventory.md`
5. `tech-debt-baseline.md`
6. `client-build-strategy.md`
7. `plan-deviations.md`
8. `wave-<N>-exit-verification.log`
9. `provider-smoke/` logs and smoke summaries

## Program Rules

1. Add one wave verification log per wave exit.
2. Record any scope/sequence deviation in `plan-deviations.md`.
3. Keep a current client build strategy note when Turbopack behavior changes.
4. Do not delete historical wave logs; append new logs only.
