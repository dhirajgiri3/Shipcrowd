      summary: Get access_token for use in api requests
      description: |
        Use this api call to fetch a _access_token_ and _token_type_ which is valid for _expires_in_
        seconds (generally 24 hours).
        For all our protected api calls, you need to pass this access_token as an `Authorization` header.

        For eg: if _access_token_ value is **abc123**, and _token_type_ is **Bearer**, the header will be:
        `Authorization: Bearer abc123`

        **Notes:**
        1. This API works with both v1 and v2 APIs.
        2. This is a caching API and will return the same token for a period of 24h. The _expires_in_ will keep decreasing appropriately with subsequent fetches.

        Few Key points when using the API
        ### Forward Shipments
        _From seller to customer_
        - `payment_mode` should be **COD** or **Prepaid**
        - `return_reason` need not be sent
        - `drop_location` is the customer address
        - `drop_location.name` is generally the same value as `consignee_name`
          - Exception can be when a different person is receiving the shipment at the `drop_location` than the _consignee_
        - `pickup_location` is the seller warehouse/pickup address
        - `return_location` is the RTO (Return to Origin) address if the shipment is cancelled/not delivered. Generally its the same as the `pickup_location`
        - `preferred_dispatch_date` can be sent to schedule pickup of the shipment for a future date.
        - `delayed_dispatch` (Only for non large shipments)

          - If set to true, `preferred_dispatch_date` can be set using the Update Dispatch Date API post shipment creation. `preferred_dispatch_date` must not be passed along with this flag.

          - If `delayed_dispatch` is false or not sent, the shipment will be dispatched on `preferred_dispatch_date`.

          Contact your account manager to enable delayed dispatch on your account.

        ### Reverse Shipments
        _From customer to seller_
        - `payment_mode` should be **Pickup**
        - `return_reason` needs a String reason for the reverse pickup, eg: _Wrong product sent_
        - Following is just like the Forward shipment values.

          - Note this is semantically opposite to what is happening on the ground;
        the _drop_location_ is the customer address and the _pickup_location_ is the seller address.
          - `drop_location` is the customer address
          - `drop_location.name` is generally the same value as `consignee_name`

            - Exception can be when a different person is receiving the shipment at the `drop_location` than the _consignee_

          - `pickup_location` is the seller warehouse/pickup address
          - `return_location` can be ignored


        ### Autofill Pickup/Return location
        The `pickup_location` and `return_location` are seller warehouses/addresses registered with us **beforehand** or using the **Address** apis.
        We can autofill these values in the api call accordingly.

        1. If you have just **one pickup_location/return_location** registered with us, you can ignore these fields completely in the above api calls.
        2. If you have **multiple pickup_location/return_location** registered with us, you can just send us the **alias** of the address in the api call.
            ```json
            "pickup_location": {
              "name": "Pickup_location_alias" // as sent in Address
            },
            "return_location": {
              "name": "Return_location_alias" // as sent in Address
            }
            ```
        3. You can register a new pickup/return location with us by contacting your account manager. We do plan to expose an api for this soon.
        4. If the `return_location` field is not sent completely, we automatically assume its the same as the `pickup_location`.

        _Note:_ The above DOES NOT apply to _drop_location_ since it is different every time.


        ### Packaging Template
        The packaging template is the way to define the packaging dimensions. By providing `templateName` you can instruct system to pick pre-defined package dimensions for the shipment manifestation.

        _Sending package information with API request_
        ```json
        "templateName":"Template #1"
        ```

        _You can find template name in Ekart dashboard within Packaging feature_

        1. If you send `templateName` with request, system will pick the dimensions from pre-defined package template. If template is not found, request gets rejected.
        2. Only one of `templateName` or `length, width, height` will be accepted.

        _Note:_ Do not send _templateName_ and _length, width, height_ both, there is a higher chance of request rejection.

        ### Multi-package Forward Shipments (MPS)
          - `mps` should be **true**
          - `items` array is required
          - `packages` array is required

        Send `items` and `packages` in the standard format as defined in the `shipment` schema.
        `length`, `height`, `width` and `weight` at the top level of shipment schema will be ignored in this case.

        ### Open Box Delivery Shipments (OBD)
          - `obd_shipment` should be **true**

        Contact your account manager to enable Open Box Delivery for your account.

        ### Reverse Shipments with QC (Quality Check)
          - `qc_shipment` should be **true**
          - `product_name` is required
          - `product_sku` is optional
          - `product_color` is optional
          - `product_size` is optional
          - `product_desc` is optional
          - `brand_name` is optional
          - `product_category` is optional
          - `ean_barcode` is optional
          - `serial_number` is optional
          - `imei_number` is optional
          - `product_images` is optional

        ### Response and Tracking

        We return the following response on successful shipment creation:
        ```json
        {
          "status": true,
          "remark": "Successfully created shipment",
          "tracking_id": "500999A3408005", // Ekart tracking id
          "vendor": "XYZ", // vendor partner chosen
          "barcodes": { // plain text data for the scannable barcodes which are printed on the label
            "wbn": "vendor_waybill_plain_text", // vendor waybill
            "order": "order_number", // order number passed by seller (may be prefixed to keep unique for barcode)
            "cod": "vendor_cod_waybill_plain_text" // some vendors have an additional waybill/barcode for COD shipments
          }
        }
        ```
        The Ekart tracking id can be used in the tracking api to track the shipment.
        A public tracking link can also be created in the following format:
        `https://app.elite.ekartlogistics.in/track/${Ekart tracking id}`

        Example with the above data: `https://app.elite.ekartlogistics.in/track/500999A3408005`

        Certain statuses can have an associated `ndrStatus` with possible `ndrActions`.
        These can be used with the aforementioned NDR api.
