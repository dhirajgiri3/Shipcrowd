Shipcrowd Backend Master Plan
12-16 Week CANON-Compliant Implementation Strategy
Generated: December 25, 2025 Project: Shipcrowd - Shipping Aggregator Platform Current Completion: 24% Backend Target: 100% Production-Ready Backend Timeline: 12-16 weeks, Solo Developer (8-10 hours/day) Methodology: CANON AI-Native Development
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN OVERVIEW
This comprehensive master plan will transform Shipcrowd backend from 24% to 100% completion over 12-16 weeks using CANON AI-native methodology.
Key Implementation Decisions
Technology Stack:
Backend: Node.js + TypeScript + Express + MongoDB (existing)
AI/ML: OpenAI API (JavaScript integration, mock key: sk-proj-xxxxx)
Payment: Razorpay SDK only
Courier: Shiprocket Custom API only (12 endpoints)
PDF: PDFKit for labels/invoices/manifests
Cache: Redis for performance
Jobs: Bull for background processing
Testing: Jest + Supertest (existing, 60% → 80%+ coverage)
Refactoring Strategy:
Week 1: Fix race conditions, establish CANON workflow, create context packages
Weeks 2-5: Core operations (courier, payment, documents, warehouse)
Refactor-first approach: Fix existing before adding new
Testing Coverage Targets:
Payment & Courier: 80%+ (critical)
Core Features: 70%+
Support Features: 60%+
All critical paths: 100% integration tests
Detail Levels:
